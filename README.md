# Kind's Crystal Optimizer

Kind's Crystal Optimizer is a performance-focused Fabric mod that reduces perceived crystal placement and break delay using client-side prediction. It removes broken crystals instantly on the client instead of waiting for server confirmation, resulting in smoother crystal interactions, especially on high-latency connections.
